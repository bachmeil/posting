# It was really easy to set up this website

- I created a new Github repo and enabled Github Pages.
- I created a file called `_config.yml` with only the content: `remote_theme: bachmeil/rain`.
- I wrote this post in the VS Code web editor. Hit `.` on your Github repo to open the editor.
- I committed the post.
- Profit.
