# It was really easy to set up this website

- I created a new Github repo and enabled Github Pages.
- I created a file called `_config.yml` with only the content: `remote_theme: bachmeil/rain`.
- I dumped this (optional) information into `_config.yml`:
    
```
# Site settings
title:          Lance Bachmeier
description:    "Content I find interesting"

# Author
author:
  name:         Lance Bachmeier
  url:          https://lancebachmeier.com
```

- I wrote this post in the VS Code web editor. Hit `.` on your Github repo to open the editor.
- I committed the post.
- Profit.

The remote theme I linked above has equation support. Single dollar signs for inline equations: $y_{t} = x_{t} + \nu_{t}$

Double dollar signs for displayed equations:
\\(y_{t} = x_{t} + \nu_{t}\\)
